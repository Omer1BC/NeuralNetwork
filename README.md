Summary
-
Neural Network Implementation in Java, No External Libraries

Collab with 2 friends, responsible for pre-processing the data and front-end gui respectively

Overview
-

This project involves creating a neural network from scratch using Java. The neural network is a basic feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

Neural Network Architecture

The neural network consists of the following components:

Input Layer: Accepts input features.

Hidden Layer: Contains neurons with a sigmoid activation function.

Output Layer: Produces the final output.

Implementation Details
-
The backpropagation algorithm is implemented to update weights and biases during the training process. This involves computing gradients and adjusting parameters to minimize the error.
